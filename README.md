                <h1 class="title">Virginia, the data center capital of the world, has a higher percentage of households without Internet than most U.S. states</h1>
                <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
                <p> I created this project as a student in The Lede Program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. My goal was to explore Internet habits in the U.S. as a lens for understanding data center growth trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I explored data from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's <a href="https://ntia.gov/other-publication/2022/digital-nation-data-explorer#sel=internetUser&disp=map">Internet Use Survey</a> in csv format. I was immediately struck by the high percentage of homes without Internet in the state of Virginia, compared to other U.S. states and past years, given that Virginia is known to have the largest number of data centers of any U.S. state. Overall, 34 % of households in Virginia had no Internet in 2021, compared with a national average of 23 percent. My goal was to show the contrast between the percentage of households without home Internet in Virginia, and the state's vast quantity of data centers that support global Internet activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used pandas to further explore the data; convert string arguments to datetime; rename the columns; and create a smaller dataframe focusing on the percentages of households per state that lacked Internet access at home from 2011-2021. I used Datawrapper to plot the data into a choropleth map and a line chart. 
                </p>
                <p> I used an additional small data set from the <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/en/trends-and-insights/research/data-center-outlook">2023 Data Centers Global Outlook report</a> report by real estate company <i>JLL</i> to create a stacked bar graph. I also conducted qualitative research through publications to provide additional context to the story.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">Skills Learned</h2>
                <p>To create this project, I developed skills in data exploration and cleaning through pandas, creating maps and graphs in Datawrapper, creating an index.html file using Visual Style Code and HTML, and pulling everything together for publication via Github. I also developed first-hand experience working to understand the context of a government data set with hundreds of rows and columns in order to frame findings in an accurate light. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">Future Work</h2>
                <p>To further develop this story, I aim to find data sets showing the number of data centers constructed and operated in each U.S. state over the last ten years, and their environmental impacts and energy demands. Since there is no national database providing this information, collecting this data is a challenge. I also hope to gain greater knowledge about the collection processes and significance of the U.S. Census data used for this project, and the potential reasons for the high rate of households in Virginia that do not have Internet access, when compared with other U.S. states.
